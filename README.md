# SeaDronesSee
Vision Benchmark for Maritime Search and Rescue

SeaDronesSee is a large-scale data set aimed at helping develop systems for Search and Rescue (SAR) using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in maritime scenarios. Building highly complex autonomous UAV systems that aid in SAR missions requires robust computer vision algorithms to detect and track objects or persons of interest. This data set provides three sets of tracks: object detection, single-object tracking and multi-object tracking. Each track consists of its own data set and leaderboard. 

This repository contains evaluation kits, code and model samples and links to the SeaDronesSee benchmark.
